Line:202)PREFACE.
Line:203)
Line:204)
Line:205)The present work is a modest effort to reproduce approximately, in modern
Line:206)measures, the venerable epic, Beowulf. _Approximately_, I repeat; for a
Line:207)very close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be
Line:208)prose to a modern ear.
Line:209)
Line:210)The Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed. Occasionally
Line:211)a deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient
Line:212)reason. The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while,
Line:213)however, he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted
Line:214)from the criticisms of other students of the poem.
Line:215)
Line:216)This work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike
Line:217)the translator begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he
Line:218)hopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. The student of
Line:219)English literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the
Line:220)most ancient epic of our race. This is a bold and venturesome undertaking;
Line:221)and yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow
Line:222)even a daring guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of
Line:223)Hrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the
Line:224)hearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.
Line:225)
Line:226)In order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been
Line:227)used, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of
Line:228)the original, permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading.
Line:229)
Line:230)Perhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his own theory as to how Beowulf
Line:231)should be translated. Some have given us prose versions of what we believe
Line:232)to be a great poem. Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold
Line:233)to say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is
Line:234)justly called our first _epic_? Of those translators who have used verse,
Line:235)several have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view. Is it
Line:236)proper, for instance, that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and
Line:237)Hrothgar be put in ballad measures, tripping lightly and airily along? Or,
Line:238)again, is it fitting that the rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be
Line:239)interpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse? Do we hear
Line:240)what has been beautifully called "the clanging tread of a warrior in
Line:241)mail"?
Line:242)
Line:243)[viii]
Line:244)
Line:245)Of all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone
Line:246)gives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great
Line:247)Teutonic epic.
Line:248)
Line:249)The measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a
Line:250)reproduction of the original as modern English affords. The cadences
Line:251)closely resemble those used by Browning in some of his most striking
Line:252)poems. The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as
Line:253)much thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular
Line:254)cadence. Alliteration has been used to a large extent; but it was thought
Line:255)that modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line. End-rhyme has
Line:256)been used occasionally; internal rhyme, sporadically. Both have some
Line:257)warrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. (For end-rhyme, see 1_53, 1_54; for
Line:258)internal rhyme, 2_21, 6_40.)
Line:259)
Line:260)What Gummere[1] calls the "rime-giver" has been studiously kept; _viz._,
Line:261)the first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the
Line:262)alliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only
Line:263)sporadically. Alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the
Line:264)original. (See 7_61, 8_5.)
Line:265)
Line:266)No two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally
Line:267)after a cæsural pause. (See 2_19 and 12_1.) Or, scientifically speaking,
Line:268)Sievers's C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of
Line:269)translation. Several of his types, however, constantly occur; _e.g._ A and
Line:270)a variant (/ x | / x) (/ x x | / x); B and a variant (x / | x / ) (x x / |
Line:271)x / ); a variant of D (/ x | / x x); E (/ x x | / ). Anacrusis gives
Line:272)further variety to the types used in the translation.
Line:273)
Line:274)The parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. (_E.g._,
Line:275)1_16 and 1_17: "Lord" and "Wielder of Glory"; 1_30, 1_31, 1_32; 2_12 and
Line:276)2_13; 2_27 and 2_28; 3_5 and 3_6.) Occasionally, some loss has been
Line:277)sustained; but, on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made.
Line:278)
Line:279)The effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the
Line:280)translation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have
Line:281)been avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are
Line:282)none, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry.
Line:283)
Line:284)[ix]
Line:285)
Line:286)With these preliminary remarks, it will not be amiss to give an outline of
Line:287)the story of the poem.
Line:288)
Line:289)
Line:290)_THE STORY._
Line:291)
Line:292)_Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or
Line:293)palace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents.
Line:294)The joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the
Line:295)monster, is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of
Line:296)joyance that reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and
Line:297)anon he goes to the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after
Line:298)thane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong
Line:299)enough and bold enough to cope with the monster. For twelve years he
Line:300)persecutes Hrothgar and his vassals._
Line:301)
Line:302)_Over sea, a day's voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac,
Line:303)king of the Geats, hears of Grendel's doings and of Hrothgar's misery. He
Line:304)resolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With
Line:305)fourteen chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that
Line:306)country, he soon persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours
Line:307)that elapse before night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When
Line:308)Hrothgar's bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling
Line:309)him that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his
Line:310)palace. All retire to rest, Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms._
Line:311)
Line:312)_Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God's anger. He seizes
Line:313)and kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf.
Line:314)A fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used,
Line:315)both combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears
Line:316)Grendel's shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den,
Line:317)howling and yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal._
Line:318)
Line:319)_The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall
Line:320)Heorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and
Line:321)his retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts._
Line:322)
Line:323)_Grendel's mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She
Line:324)is furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart
Line:325)[x] from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of Hrothgar's
Line:326)favorite counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is
Line:327)called. Determined to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and
Line:328)goes down to look for the female monster. After traveling through the
Line:329)waters many hours, he meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her
Line:330)den. There he sees Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal
Line:331)struggle with the woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking
Line:332)with him Grendel's head._
Line:333)
Line:334)_Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor. Hrothgar
Line:335)literally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed among
Line:336)the vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord._
Line:337)
Line:338)_Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure._
Line:339)
Line:340)_When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a
Line:341)distinguished guest. He is the hero of the hour._
Line:342)
Line:343)_Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he
Line:344)has been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried
Line:345)by a fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing
Line:346)struggle both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is
Line:347)inexpressible. They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor
Line:348)the memory of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is
Line:349)burnt. Then a memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that
Line:350)sailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national
Line:351)hero of Geatland._
Line:352)
Line:353)_The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness,
Line:354)his goodness of heart, and his generosity._

Line:358)It is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the
Line:359)story of Beowulf shall be as familiar to English-speaking peoples as that
Line:360)of the Iliad. Beowulf is our first great epic. It is an epitomized history
Line:361)of the life of the Teutonic races. It brings vividly before us our
Line:362)forefathers of pre-Alfredian eras, in their love of war, of sea, and of
Line:363)adventure.

Line:1027)    [1] For the 'Þæt' of verse 15, Sievers suggests 'Þá' (= which). If
Line:1028)    this be accepted, the sentence 'He had ... afflicted' will read: _He_
Line:1029)    (_i.e._ God) _had perceived the malice-caused sorrow which they,
Line:1030)    lordless, had formerly long endured_.
Line:1031)
Line:1032)    [2] For 'aldor-léase' (15) Gr. suggested 'aldor-ceare': _He perceived
Line:1033)    their distress, that they formerly had suffered life-sorrow a long
Line:1034)    while_.
Line:1035)
Line:1036)    [3] A very difficult passage. 'Áhte' (31) has no object. H. supplies
Line:1037)    'geweald' from the context; and our translation is based upon this
Line:1038)    assumption, though it is far from satisfactory. Kl. suggests
Line:1039)    'lændagas' for 'lange': _And the beloved land-prince enjoyed (had) his
Line:1040)    transitory days (i.e. lived)_. B. suggests a dislocation; but this is
Line:1041)    a dangerous doctrine, pushed rather far by that eminent scholar.
Line:1042)
Line:1043)    [4] The reading of the H.-So. text has been quite closely followed;
Line:1044)    but some eminent scholars read 'séle-rædenne' for 'sele-rædende.' If
Line:1045)    that be adopted, the passage will read: _Men cannot tell us, indeed,
Line:1046)    the order of Fate, etc._ 'Sele-rædende' has two things to support it:
Line:1047)    (1) v. 1347; (2) it affords a parallel to 'men' in v. 50.

Line:1293)    he could not become ruler of the Danes, on account of his hostility to

Line:1406)    [1] 'From hám' (194) is much disputed. One rendering is: _Beowulf,
Line:1407)    being away from home, heard of Hrothgar's troubles, etc_. Another,
Line:1408)    that adopted by S. and endorsed in the H.-So. notes, is: _B. heard
Line:1409)    from his neighborhood (neighbors),_ i.e. _in his home, etc_. A third
Line:1410)    is: _B., being at home, heard this as occurring away from home_. The
Line:1411)    H.-So. glossary and notes conflict.
Line:1412)
Line:1413)    [2] 'Eoletes' (224) is marked with a (?) by H.-So.; our rendering
Line:1414)    simply follows his conjecture.--Other conjectures as to 'eolet' are:
Line:1415)    (1) _voyage_, (2) _toil_, _labor_, (3) _hasty journey_.
Line:1416)
Line:1417)    [3] The lacuna of the MS at this point has been supplied by various
Line:1418)    conjectures. The reading adopted by H.-So. has been rendered in the
Line:1419)    above translation. W., like H.-So., makes 'ic' the beginning of a new
Line:1420)    sentence, but, for 'helmas bæron,' he reads 'hringed stefnan.' This
Line:1421)    has the advantage of giving a parallel to 'brontne ceol' instead of a
Line:1422)    kenning for 'go.'--B puts the (?) after 'holmas', and begins a new
Line:1423)    sentence at the middle of the line. Translate: _What warriors are ye,
Line:1424)    clad in armor, who have thus come bringing the foaming vessel over the
Line:1425)    water way, hither over the seas? For some time on the wall I have been
Line:1426)    coast guard, etc_. S. endorses most of what B. says, but leaves out
Line:1427)    'on the wall' in the last sentence. If W.'s 'hringed stefnan' be
Line:1428)    accepted, change line 51 above to, _A ring-stemmed vessel hither

Line:1696)          The mighty one rose then, with many a liegeman,

Line:1785)    [1] Some render 'gif-sceattas' by 'tribute.'--'Géata' B. and Th.
Line:1786)    emended to 'Géatum.' If this be accepted, change '_of_ the Geatmen' to
Line:1787)    '_to_ the Geatmen.'
Line:1788)
Line:1789)    [2] If t.B.'s emendation of vv. 386, 387 be accepted, the two lines,
Line:1790)    'Hasten ... kinsmen' will read: _Hasten thou, bid the throng of
Line:1791)    kinsmen go into the hall together_.
Line:1792)
Line:1793)    [3] For 420 (_b_) and 421 (_a_), B. suggests: Þær ic (on) fífelgeban
Line:1794)    ýðde eotena cyn = _where I in the ocean destroyed the
Line:1795)    eoten-race_.--t.B. accepts B.'s "brilliant" 'fífelgeban,' omits 'on,'
Line:1796)    emends 'cyn' to 'hám,' arranging: Þær ic fífelgeban ýðde, eotena hám =
Line:1797)    _where I desolated the ocean, the home of the eotens_.--This would be
Line:1798)    better but for changing 'cyn' to 'hám.'--I suggest: Þær ic fífelgeband
Line:1799)    (cf. nhd. Bande) ýðde, eotena cyn = _where I conquered the monster
Line:1800)    band, the race of the eotens_. This makes no change except to read
Line:1801)    '_fífel_' for '_fífe_.'
Line:1802)
Line:1803)    [4] 'Unforhte' (444) is much disputed.--H.-So. wavers between adj. and
Line:1804)    adv. Gr. and B. take it as an adv. modifying _etan: Will eat the Geats
Line:1805)    fearlessly_.--Kl. considers this reading absurd, and proposes
Line:1806)    'anforhte' = timid.--Understanding 'unforhte' as an adj. has this
Line:1807)    advantage, viz. that it gives a parallel to 'Geátena leóde': but to
Line:1808)    take it as an adv. is more natural. Furthermore, to call the Geats
Line:1809)    'brave' might, at this point, seem like an implied thrust at the
Line:1810)    Danes, so long helpless; while to call his own men 'timid' would be
Line:1811)    befouling his own nest.
Line:1812)
Line:1813)    [5] For 'head-watch,' cf. H.-So. notes and cf. v. 2910.--Th.
Line:1814)    translates: _Thou wilt not need my head to hide_ (i.e., thou wilt have
Line:1815)    no occasion to bury me, as Grendel will devour me whole).--Simrock
Line:1816)    imagines a kind of dead-watch.--Dr. H. Wood suggests: _Thou wilt not
Line:1817)    have to bury so much as my head_ (for Grendel will be a thorough
Line:1818)    undertaker),--grim humor.
Line:1819)
Line:1820)    [6] S. proposes a colon after 'nimeð' (l. 447). This would make no
Line:1821)    essential change in the translation.
Line:1822)
Line:1823)    [7] Owing to the vagueness of 'feorme' (451), this passage is
Line:1824)    variously translated. In our translation, H.-So.'s glossary has been
Line:1825)    quite closely followed. This agrees substantially with B.'s
Line:1826)    translation (P. and B. XII. 87). R. translates: _Thou needst not take
Line:1827)    care longer as to the consumption of my dead body._ 'Líc' is also a
Line:1828)    crux here, as it may mean living body or dead body.

Line:3298)    [2] For 'feorh' S. suggests 'feoh': 'corpse' in the translation would
Line:3299)    then be changed to '_possessions_,' '_belongings_.' This is a better

Line:3305)    [4] I believe this translation brings out the meaning of the poet,
Line:3306)    without departing seriously from the H.-So. text. 'Oft' frequently
Line:3307)    means 'constantly,' 'continually,' not always 'often.'--Why 'an (on)
Line:3308)    wíg gearwe' should be written 'ánwíg-gearwe' (= ready for single
Line:3309)    combat), I cannot see. 'Gearwe' occurs quite frequently with 'on'; cf.
Line:3310)    B. 1110 (_ready for the pyre_), El. 222 (_ready for the glad
Line:3311)    journey_). Moreover, what has the idea of single combat to do with B.
Line:3312)    1247 ff.? The poet is giving an inventory of the arms and armor which

Line:3424)    [1] Several eminent authorities either read or emend the MS. so as to
Line:3425)    make this verse read, _While Grendel was wasting the gold-bedecked
Line:3426)    palace_. So 20_15 below: _ravaged the desert_.
Line:3427)
Line:3428)    [2] For 'sóna' (1281), t.B. suggests 'sára,' limiting 'edhwyrft.' Read
Line:3429)    then: _Return of sorrows to the nobles, etc_. This emendation supplies
Line:3430)    the syntactical gap after 'edhwyrft.'
Line:3431)
Line:3432)    [3] Some authorities follow Grein's lexicon in treating 'heard ecg' as
Line:3433)    an adj. limiting 'sweord': H.-So. renders it as a subst. (So v. 1491.)
Line:3434)    The sense of the translation would be the same.
Line:3435)
Line:3436)    [4] B. suggests 'under hróf genam' (v. 1303). This emendation, as well
Line:3437)    as an emendation with (?) to v. 739, he offers, because 'under'
Line:3438)    baffles him in both passages. All we need is to take 'under' in its
Line:3439)    secondary meaning of 'in,' which, though not given by Grein, occurs in
Line:3440)    the literature. Cf. Chron. 876 (March's A.-S. Gram. § 355) and Oro.
Line:3441)    Amaz. I. 10, where 'under' = _in the midst of_. Cf. modern Eng. 'in
Line:3442)    such circumstances,' which interchanges in good usage with 'under such
Line:3443)    circumstances.'
Line:3444)
Line:3445)    [5] For 'néod-laðu' (1321) C. suggests 'néad-láðum,' and translates:

Line:3962)    (Sweet's ed.) 178_7; 204_34; 208_28; 210_15; 280_20. In the two

Line:3969)    The second passage (v. 2025 (b)-2027): _She is promised ...; to this
Line:3970)    the friend of the Scyldings has agreed, etc_. By emending 'is' instead
Line:3971)    of 'wæs' (2025), the tenses will be brought into perfect harmony.

Line:4338)       55 And claspèd his neck; tears from him fell,
Line:4339)          From the gray-headed man: he two things expected,

Line:4353)          As they pressed on their way then, the present of Hrothgar
Line:4354)
Line:4355){Giving liberally is the true proof of kingship.}
Line:4356)
Line:4357)          Was frequently referred to: a folk-king indeed that

Line:4367)    scholars ask. But the weeping is mentioned before the 'expectations':

Line:4459)       60 O'er the fallow flood by her father's instructions
Line:4460)          She sought on her journey, where she afterwards fully,
Line:4461)          Famed for her virtue, her fate on the king's-seat

Line:4469)       70 For help unto heroes, Heming's kinsman,

Line:4471)
Line:4472)    [1] For 'scawan' (1896), 'scaðan' has been proposed. Accepting this,
Line:4473)    we may render: _He said the bright-armored warriors were going to
Line:4474)    their vessel, welcome, etc_. (Cf. 1804.)
Line:4475)
Line:4476)    [2] R. suggests, 'Gewát him on naca,' and renders: _The vessel set
Line:4477)    out, to drive on the sea, the Dane-country left_. 'On' bears the
Line:4478)    alliteration; cf. 'on hafu' (2524). This has some advantages over the
Line:4479)    H.-So. reading; viz. (1) It adds nothing to the text; (2) it makes
Line:4480)    'naca' the subject, and thus brings the passage into keeping with the
Line:4481)    context, where the poet has exhausted his vocabulary in detailing the
Line:4482)    actions of the vessel.--B.'s emendation (cf. P. and B. XII. 97) is
Line:4483)    violent.
Line:4484)
Line:4485)    [3] B. translates: _Who for a long time, ready at the coast, had
Line:4486)    looked out into the distance eagerly for the dear men_. This changes
Line:4487)    the syntax of 'léofra manna.'
Line:4488)
Line:4489)    [4] For 'wunað' (v. 1924) several eminent critics suggest 'wunade'
Line:4490)    (=remained). This makes the passage much clearer.
Line:4491)
Line:4492)    [5] Why should such a woman be described as an 'excellent' queen? C.
Line:4493)    suggests 'frécnu' = dangerous, bold.
Line:4494)
Line:4495)    [6] For 'an dæges' various readings have been offered. If 'and-éges'
Line:4496)    be accepted, the sentence will read: _No hero ... dared look upon her,
Line:4497)    eye to eye_. If 'án-dæges' be adopted, translate: _Dared look upon her
Line:4498)    the whole day_.

Line:5061)
Line:5062)    [2] For 'hard-fyrdne' (2246), B. first suggested 'hard-fyndne,'
Line:5063)    rendering: _A heap of treasures ... so great that its equal would be

Line:5077)    [6] The reading of H.-So. is well defended in the notes to that

Line:5328)    The verses 2451 to 2463-1/2 would be parenthetical, the poet's feelings
Line:5329)    being so strong as to interrupt the simile. The punctuation of the

Line:5814)
Line:5815)    [3] For 'gefyldan' (2707), S. proposes 'gefylde.' The passage would
Line:5816)    read: _He felled the foe (life drove out strength), and they then both
Line:5817)    had destroyed him, chieftains related_. This gives Beowulf the credit
Line:5818)    of having felled the dragon; then they combine to annihilate him.--For
Line:5819)    'ellen' (2707), Kl. suggests 'e(a)llne.'--The reading '_life drove out

Line:6314)    [2] For 'segn Higeláce,' K., Th., and B. propose 'segn Higeláces,'
Line:6315)    meaning: _Higelac's banner followed the Swedes (in pursuit)._--S.
Line:6316)    suggests 'sæcc Higeláces,' and renders: _Higelac's pursuit._--The
Line:6317)    H.-So. reading, as translated in our text, means that the banner of
Line:6318)    the enemy was captured and brought to Higelac as a trophy.
Line:6319)
Line:6320)    [3] The rendering given in this translation represents the king as
Line:6321)    being generous beyond the possibility of reproach; but some
Line:6322)    authorities construe 'him' (2996) as plu., and understand the passage
Line:6323)    to mean that no one reproached the two brothers with having received
Line:6324)    more reward than they were entitled to.
Line:6325)
Line:6326)    [4] The name 'Scyldingas' here (3006) has caused much discussion, and
Line:6327)    given rise to several theories, the most important of which are as
Line:6328)    follows: (1) After the downfall of Hrothgar's family, Beowulf was king
Line:6329)    of the Danes, or Scyldings. (2) For 'Scyldingas' read
Line:6330)    'Scylfingas'--that is, after killing Eadgils, the Scylfing prince,
Line:6331)    Beowulf conquered his land, and held it in subjection. (3) M.
Line:6332)    considers 3006 a thoughtless repetition of 2053. (Cf. H.-So.)
Line:6333)
Line:6334)    [5] B. takes 'nihtes' and 'hwílum' (3045) as separate adverbial cases,
Line:6335)    and renders: _Joy in the air had he of yore by night, etc_. He thinks
Line:6336)    that the idea of vanished time ought to be expressed.
Line:6337)
Line:6338)    [6] The parenthesis is by some emended so as to read: (1) (_He_ (i.e.
Line:6339)    _God_) _is the hope of men_); (2) (_he is the hope of heroes_). Gr.'s
Line:6340)    reading has no parenthesis, but says: ... _could touch, unless God
Line:6341)    himself, true king of victories, gave to whom he would to open the
Line:6342)    treasure, the secret place of enchanters, etc_. The last is rejected
Line:6343)    on many grounds.

Line:6350)WIGLAF'S SAD STORY.--THE HOARD CARRIED OFF.

Line:6352)
Line:6353)          Then 'twas seen that the journey prospered him little
Line:6354)          Who wrongly within had the ornaments hidden[1]
Line:6355)          Down 'neath the wall. The warden erst slaughtered
Line:6356)          Some few of the folk-troop: the feud then thereafter
Line:6357)        5 Was hotly avengèd. 'Tis a wonder where,[2]
Line:6358)          When the strength-famous trooper has attained to the end of
Line:6359)          Life-days allotted, then no longer the man may
Line:6360)          Remain with his kinsmen where mead-cups are flowing.
Line:6361)          So to Beowulf happened when the ward of the barrow,
Line:6362)       10 Assaults, he sought for: himself had no knowledge
Line:6363)          How his leaving this life was likely to happen.
Line:6364)          So to doomsday, famous folk-leaders down did
Line:6365)          Call it with curses--who 'complished it there--
Line:6366)[104]     That that man should be ever of ill-deeds convicted,
Line:6367)       15 Confined in foul-places, fastened in hell-bonds,
Line:6368)          Punished with plagues, who this place should e'er ravage.[3]
Line:6369)          He cared not for gold: rather the Wielder's
Line:6370)          Favor preferred he first to get sight of.[4]

Line:6372){Wiglaf addresses his comrades.}
Line:6373)
Line:6374)          Wiglaf discoursed then, Wihstan his son:

Line:6381)          Till the end of the world. Met we a destiny

Line:6412)
Line:6413){Wiglaf charges them to build a funeral-pyre.}
Line:6414)
Line:6415)          Then the son of Wihstan bade orders be given,
Line:6416)          Mood-valiant man, to many of heroes,
Line:6417)          Holders of homesteads, that they hither from far,
Line:6418)          [6]Leaders of liegemen, should look for the good one
Line:6419)       55 With wood for his pyre: "The flame shall now swallow
Line:6420)          (The wan fire shall wax[7]) the warriors' leader
Line:6421)          Who the rain of the iron often abided,
Line:6422)          When, sturdily hurled, the storm of the arrows
Line:6423)          Leapt o'er linden-wall, the lance rendered service,
Line:6424)       60 Furnished with feathers followed the arrow."
Line:6425)          Now the wise-mooded son of Wihstan did summon
Line:6426)          The best of the braves from the band of the ruler
Line:6427)
Line:6428){He takes seven thanes, and enters the den.}
Line:6429)

Line:6431)          Went with the seven; one of the heroes

Line:6444)
Line:6445){The hoard is laid on a wain.}
Line:6446)
Line:6447)          There wounden gold on a wain was uploaded,
Line:6448)       75 A mass unmeasured, the men-leader off then,
Line:6449)          The hero hoary, to Whale's-Ness was carried.
Line:6450)
Line:6451)    [1] For 'gehýdde,' B. suggests 'gehýðde': the passage would stand as
Line:6452)    above except the change of 'hidden' (v. 2) to 'plundered.' The
Line:6453)    reference, however, would be to the thief, not to the dragon.
Line:6454)
Line:6455)    [2] The passage 'Wundur ... búan' (3063-3066), M. took to be a
Line:6456)    question asking whether it was strange that a man should die when his
Line:6457)    appointed time had come.--B. sees a corruption, and makes emendations
Line:6458)    introducing the idea that a brave man should not die from sickness or
Line:6459)    from old age, but should find death in the performance of some deed of
Line:6460)    daring.--S. sees an indirect question introduced by 'hwár' and
Line:6461)    dependent upon 'wundur': _A secret is it when the hero is to die,
Line:6462)    etc_.--Why may the two clauses not be parallel, and the whole passage
Line:6463)    an Old English cry of '_How wonderful is death!'?_--S.'s is the best
Line:6464)    yet offered, if 'wundor' means 'mystery.'
Line:6465)
Line:6466)    [3] For 'strude' in H.-So., S. suggests 'stride.' This would require
Line:6467)    'ravage' (v. 16) to be changed to 'tread.'
Line:6468)
Line:6469)    [4] 'He cared ... sight of' (17, 18), S. emends so as to read as
Line:6470)    follows: _He (Beowulf) had not before seen the favor of the avaricious
Line:6471)    possessor._
Line:6472)
Line:6473)    [5] B. renders: _That which drew the king thither_ (i.e. _the
Line:6474)    treasure_) _was granted us, but in such a way that it overcomes us._
Line:6475)
Line:6476)    [6] 'Folc-ágende' (3114) B. takes as dat. sing. with 'gódum,' and
Line:6477)    refers it to Beowulf; that is, _Should bring fire-wood to the place
Line:6478)    where the good folk-ruler lay_.
Line:6479)
Line:6480)    [7] C. proposes to take 'weaxan' = L. 'vescor,' and translate
Line:6481)    _devour_. This gives a parallel to 'fretan' above. The parenthesis
Line:6482)    would be discarded and the passage read: _Now shall the fire consume,
Line:6483)    the wan-flame devour, the prince of warriors, etc_.

Line:6566)Several discrepancies and other oversights have been noticed in the H.-So.
Line:6567)glossary. Of these a good part were avoided by Harrison and Sharp, the
Line:6568)American editors of Beowulf, in their last edition, 1888. The rest will, I
Line:6569)hope, be noticed in their fourth edition. As, however, this book may fall
Line:6570)into the hands of some who have no copy of the American edition, it seems
Line:6571)best to notice all the principal oversights of the German editors.
Line:6572)
Line:6573)~From hám~ (194).--Notes and glossary conflict; the latter not having been
Line:6574)altered to suit the conclusions accepted in the former.
Line:6575)

Line:6582)~Heatho-ræmas~ (519).--Under 'ætberan' H. translates 'to the Heathoremes';
Line:6583)while under 'Heatho-ræmas' he says 'Heathoræmas reaches Breca in the
Line:6584)swimming-match with Beowulf.' Harrison and Sharp (3d edition, 1888) avoid
Line:6585)the discrepancy.
Line:6586)
Line:6587)~Fáh féond-scaða~ (554).--Under 'féond-scaða' H. says 'a gleaming
Line:6588)sea-monster'; under 'fáh' he says 'hostile.'
Line:6589)
Line:6590)~Onfeng hraðe inwit-þancum~ (749).--Under 'onfón' H. says 'he _received_
Line:6591)the maliciously-disposed one'; under 'inwit-þanc' he says 'he _grasped_,'
Line:6592)etc.
Line:6593)
Line:6594)~Níð-wundor séon~ (1366).--Under 'níð-wundor' H. calls this word itself
Line:6595)_nom. sing._; under 'séon' he translates it as accus. sing., understanding
Line:6596)'man' as subject of 'séon.' H. and S. (3d edition) make the correction.
Line:6597)
Line:6598)~Forgeaf hilde-bille~ (1521).--H., under the second word, calls it instr.
Line:6599)dat.; while under 'forgifan' he makes it the dat. of indir. obj. H. and S.
Line:6600)(3d edition) make the change.

Line:6605)
Line:6606)[110]
Line:6607)
Line:6608)~Yðelíce~ (1557).--Under this word H. makes it modify 'ástód.' If this be
Line:6609)right, the punctuation of the fifth edition is wrong. See H. and S.,
Line:6610)appendix.
Line:6611)
Line:6612)~Sélran gesóhte~ (1840).--Under 'sél' and 'gesécan' H. calls these two
Line:6613)words accus. plu.; but this is clearly an error, as both are nom. plu.,
Line:6614)pred. nom. H. and S. correct under 'sél.'
Line:6615)
Line:6616)~Wið sylfne~ (1978).--Under 'wið' and 'gesittan' H. says 'wið = near, by';

Line:6619)~þéow~ (2225) is omitted from the glossary.
Line:6620)
Line:6621)~For duguðum~ (2502).--Under 'duguð' H. translates this phrase, 'in

Line:6623)
Line:6624)~þær~ (2574).--Under 'wealdan' H. translates _þær_ by 'wo'; under 'mótan,'
Line:6625)by 'da.' H. and S. suggest 'if' in both passages.
Line:6626)
Line:6627)~Wunde~ (2726).--Under 'wund' H. says 'dative,' and under 'wæl-bléate' he
Line:6628)says 'accus.' It is without doubt accus., parallel with 'benne.'
Line:6629)
Line:6630)~Strengum gebæded~ (3118).--Under 'strengo' H. says 'Strengum' = mit
Line:6631)Macht; under 'gebæded' he translates 'von den Sehnen.' H. and S. correct
Line:6632)this discrepancy by rejecting the second reading.
Line:6633)
Line:6634)~Bronda be láfe~ (3162).--A recent emendation. The fourth edition had
Line:6635)'bronda betost.' In the fifth edition the editor neglects to change the

Line:6706)things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
Line:6707)even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Line:6732)the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement

Line:6908)people in all walks of life.
Line:6909)

Line:6911)assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
Line:6912)goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

Line:6914)Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
Line:6915)and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Line:6947)Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Line:6948)Literary Archive Foundation
Line:6949)
Line:6950)Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
Line:6951)spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
Line:6952)increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
Line:6953)freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
Line:6954)array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
Line:6955)($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
Line:6956)status with the IRS.
Line:6957)
Line:6958)The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
Line:6959)charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
Line:6960)States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
Line:6961)considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
Line:6962)with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
Line:6963)where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
Line:6964)SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
Line:6965)particular state visit http://pglaf.org

Line:6967)While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
Line:6968)have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
Line:6969)against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
Line:6970)approach us with offers to donate.
Line:6971)
Line:6972)International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
Line:6973)any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
Line:6974)outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Line:6978)ways including including checks, online payments and credit card

Line:6985)Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
Line:6986)concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared

Line:6988)Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Line:6991)Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
Line:6992)editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
Line:6993)unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
Line:6994)keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
